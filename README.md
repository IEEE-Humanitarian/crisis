## **I will not be updating the list anymore (as of Fri March 27, 2020), lets support existing efforts**

<s>Given the highly diverse decision making process throughout IEEE, this repository lists known efforts that members, groups or IEEE Organisational Units may help or that IEEE may support. 
To implement a lightweight tracking board, volunteers will document issues to a level sufficient for volunteers to get involved. Reviewed issues will belabeled with the "READY" status. 
If inidviduals or groups would like to use this board to ask questions, submit problems with the issues or ask for help, they can use one of the lables under the "TO-DO" column.
Finally, we will monitor progress and status on a regular basis to close issues.<s/>

Issues are grouped using labels to provide a "Kanban" view of their status, with five (5) bins:

| **[NEW]** | **[READY]** | [IN-PROGRESS] | [TO-DO]        | [DONE]      |
| --------- | ----------- | ------------- | -------------- | ----------- |
|           |             |               |  [bug]         | [duplicate] |
|           |             |               |  [help wanted] | [invalid]   |
|           |             |               |  [question]    | [wontfix]   |
